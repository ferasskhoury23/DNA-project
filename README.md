# DNA-Project

## Expected Inputs

We expect inputs as follows:

1. **JSON file defining the shortmers**  
   - The keys should follow the format `(X1, X2, X3, ...)`, sorted in order.
   - The values represent a sequence of DNA reads.

2. **DNA file containing the sequence**

## Output Files

The output files generated by the simulation are:

1. `files/alphabets.json`: Defines the alphabets generated according to the shortmers from the user.
2. `files/output_sequence_str.json`: Contains the simulation result with reads described as full sequences.
3. `files/output_symbols_str.json`: Contains the simulation result with reads described as symbols.
4. `files/output_statistics.json`: Contains the simulation statistics.
5. `files/output_errors_cluster.json`: Lists clusters after planting errors.
6. `files/final_result.json`: Shows the result of fixing errors by clusters.
7. `files/result_strand.json`: Contains the final fixed strand.

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation:

1. Ensure you have the input files as described. Sample input files are located in the `files` directory.
2. Update the input file paths in the `main.py` file.
3. Run `main.py`. The output files will be saved in the `files` directory.
